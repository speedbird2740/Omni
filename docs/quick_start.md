# Quick Start


## Requirements

### System requirements
 - Operating system: tested on Windows 10 and 11
 - Python 3.x. **It is strongly recommended you use a virtual environment.**

### Accounts/API requirements
 - Discord bot application/API key
 - Either Google custom search API key and client CX or Bing API key
 - NASA API key (may still work without one)


## Instalation 
1. Download the latest setup cli utility.
2. Create a new folder and copy the setup utility in there.
3. Open a terminal session in the folder.
4. Run the following command depending on your operating system
 - Virtual Envirtonment: `path/to/python/venv/executable setup_cli.py --setup`
 - Windows: `python setup_cli.py --setup`
 - MacOS/Linux: `python3 setup_cli.py --setup`

### Important notes
- If you do not have a NASA API key, you may put `DEMO_KEY` as your API key. However, it is recommended you [get an API key](https://api.nasa.gov).
