## Disclaimer
Code inside the functions is old, and I never bothered
to adapt the code after multiple code restructures.
Therefore, usage of certain methods can be clunky.

I will refactor the code here in the future.

## Method Descriptions


### getdata() -> Multiple
sends a request to sites, parses their HTML, and returns
useful data.


### spacex_data() -> dict
Sends request to NASA and SpaceX APIs and returns the responses
in two dictionaries.
